# InSpace

## Use cases (direct):
* Determine biomanufacturing relevance for bacteria-of-interest based on data from bacterial space research

## Use cases (implicit): 
* Search KEGG database for microbe 
  * Function - check if microbial data exists in KEGG
  * Input - two set of strings (the Latin name Genus + species) of a microbe
  * Output - three/four letter code from KEGG (search our CSV) 

* Determine if transcriptional data already exists for a bacteria-of-interest in the NASA GeneLab data repository.
  * Function - query the database for user-input bacteria along with transcriptional data
  * Input - two set of strings (the Latin name Genus + species) of bacteria
  * Output - message in the form of a sting indicating the transcriptional data does or does not already exist in the database, along with a visualization of viability scores if the bacterial data does exist

* Assign input microbe a degree of relatedness to microbes present in NASA database
  * Function - use Convolutional neural network (CNN) ML algorithm to predict relatedness
  * Input - float of point coordinates of microbe of interestâ€™s gene expression level
  * Output - float percentage of predicted microbial relatedness

* Generate visualization of predicted viability scores for input microbe in-space environment
  * Function - visualize predicted survivability scores as set number of sliding scale bars or spider/radar plots using matplotlib
  * Input - floats of predicted scores generated based on degree of relatedness score(s)
  * Output - set number of sliding scale bars or a spider/radar plot of survivability scores
