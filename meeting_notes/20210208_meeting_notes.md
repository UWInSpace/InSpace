## Summary: 
* Large dataset --> use DASH (need 1 week to self learn)
* Can try SQL for database
* Self-learning tasks --> assign task to each person
* Big dataset, where do we store it? --> Narrow it down to 10-20 organisms only
* What are we going to do with this data? Prediction, clustering, PCA, etc? what type of algorithm?
* Useful use case?
* Feasible to be done in time?
* Do we have enough data?

* Planning stage:
	* Get it done in the first week! stick with the plan
	* Get the github working right away (might be encountering merging problem, rendering problem)

* List of tools:
	* Diff analysis for expression (someone has to learn it)
	* microbes clustering with PCA (python code available)
        * Maybe SQL to make one organized database for data management
        * Need cloud computing (edited)
