*Original:*
With the NASA GeneLab and KEGG datasets, our group aims to (1) compile transcriptomics and protein expression data on the effects of radiation and microgravity (2) build potential pathways for user-defined chemical-of-interest and desired environment based on active genes (3) (if pathway is missing) predict potential genes/pathways from the closest-related organism or organisms under similar environmental conditions

###Discussion 2/4/2021
Data analysis steps:
• Transcripts of bacteria in space/ align transcripts with terrestrial (ctrl) organism differential expression analysis (which genes are up/down regulated) annotate gene and protein (pretty sure there’s some free software/codes available)

## Data:
• Transcriptomics from Gene lab
•gene up/down-regulated ??
•Meta-data: 
•growth conditions (the ML algorithm would learn to put weight on the parameters)
•machinery parameters (rotating reactor, etc)

How are people going to use our system?
•Biomanufacturing in space?
•chemically unstable compounds would degrade in space
•producing it on space will be more sustainable
•User inputs? XXX
•Our outputs:
	•ECLLS compatible
	•peptide as monomer
	•protein domains for biocatalysis compared it to metab pathway of compound of interest
	•optim conditions

##As a group: Work on our use cases (will be our class HW as well)

Create repository
Upload a readme file for use cases
